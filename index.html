<h2> About Me: </h2>

<p>My name is Dominic Varchetto and I am from Burr Ridge, IL. I am currently a fourth year student
    studying Aviation Administration and plan on minoring in Business. Ever since I was young, I
    loved to travel and that is why I ended up with Aviation as a major. In the future, I hope to 
    work for one of the major airline carriers. I'm from a family of five which consists of my mom,
    dad, sister, and brother. While my siblings and I go to school full time, my mom and dad both work.
    In addition, we also have a one year old puppy named Maverick. </p>

    <h2>  What I hope to learn in this course... </h2>
   <p> - How to code and build a complete website. <br>
        - Learn the different programming languages. <br>
        - Becoming familiar with the language. <br>
        - Exploring new tools used in the CS world. <br>
        - Learning the different definitions and terms. </p>
    
    <p> I'm confident that I will be able to do all of these things once the semester ends and I'm 
    excited to see what is in store! </p>

<h2> Hobbies and Activities that I enjoy... </h2>
    <p> There are many hobbies and activities that I enjoy doing outside of class and school. 
         Some hobbies that I have are coaching, hanging out with friends and family, playing hockey,
         traveling, and being outdoors. Some of my favorite places I've been able to explore and 
         travel to have been Hawaii, San Francisco, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Aruba, Canada, Destin, and
         others. Hockey wise, I've been playing the sport ever since I was young. My dad played growing
        up and my brother as well. I played for the same club I'm coaching at now which is pretty neat. </p>
    
    <h2> Fun Fact... </h2>
    <p> I have a twin sister who is one minute older than me. <br>
